Hello, my name is Peter Steele and I am currently a Full Stack Developer. I just graduated in August 2021 and am learning the ropes in my new role. I have a passion for programming and really enjoying building things from scratch. I am now working on learning how to integrate and work with existing codebases and learn the structures and everything that comprises of at my new role which is great fun and I am learning lots! 

I have been coding off and on since around 2004, though started to take it more seriously in 2015 and went back to school in 2018. One day I hope to create some awesome open source software that people really enjoy and get to continue to work on projects and code.
